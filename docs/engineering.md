# LP Ranger — Engineering Reference

This is the canonical reference for configuration, runtime state, development
tools, and the check-report pipeline. It covers every environment variable,
every on-disk file the app reads or writes, every npm script, and the CI /
reporting workflow.

For a higher-level overview of how the bot and dashboard cooperate, see
[`docs/architecture.md`](architecture.md). The HTTP route surface is
documented interactively via Swagger — see the
[API Documentation](#api-documentation) section below for how to start it.
The execution entry point itself is described in the
[`server.js`](#serverjs) section below, which walks through the startup
sequence.

## Terminology

In this codebase an **epoch** is a P&L tracking period that spans one NFT
position's lifetime — from mint to drain (rebalance). Each rebalance closes
the current epoch and opens a new one for the freshly minted NFT. This is
unrelated to the blockchain meaning of "epoch" (a fixed group of blocks used
for consensus or validator rotation).

---

## Quick Start

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values.
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start` — dashboard + bot (if wallet key available)
4. `npm run bot` — headless bot only (no dashboard)

---

## Command-Line Flags

- `--verbose`, `-v` — Enable verbose logging. Shows per-cycle fee details and
  out-of-range poll diagnostics that are hidden by default. Can also be set
  via `VERBOSE=1` in `.env` or environment.
- `--help`, `-h` — Show all command-line options and exit.

---

## Environment Variables

**All settings in this section live in `.env`** at the project root. Copy
[`.env.example`](../.env.example) to `.env` and edit the values you need.
Every variable below is read by [`src/config.js`](../src/config.js) at
startup. Nothing in this section belongs in
`app-config/static-tunables/chains.json`, `app-config/.bot-config.json`, or
`app-config/api-keys.json` — for those files, see the
[The `app-config` Directory](#the-app-config-directory) section below.

### Server (`.env`)

- `PORT` — HTTP port (default: `5555`)
- `HOST` — Bind address (default: `0.0.0.0`)

### Chain Selection (`.env`)

- `CHAIN_NAME` — Blockchain to connect to (default: `pulsechain`). Set to
  `pulsechain-testnet` for PulseChain Testnet v4. `CHAIN_NAME` selects which
  entry the bot loads out of `app-config/static-tunables/chains.json`; the
  per-chain RPC endpoints, contract addresses, and gas multipliers
  themselves live in that file, not in `.env`.

### Wallet (`.env`, Required for Bot)

- `PRIVATE_KEY` — Hex private key (`0x`-prefixed)

### Position Discovery (`.env`)

- `POSITION_ID` — NFT token ID to manage (leave blank for auto-scan)
- `ERC20_POSITION_ADDRESS` — ERC-20 position token address (blank for NFT-only)

### Bot Behaviour (`.env`)

- `RPC_URL` — JSON-RPC endpoint (default: `https://rpc-pulsechain.g4mm4.io`)
- `RPC_URL_FALLBACK` — Fallback RPC (default: `https://rpc.pulsechain.com`)
- `REBALANCE_OOR_THRESHOLD_PCT` — % beyond boundary to trigger rebalance
  (default: `10`)
- `REBALANCE_TIMEOUT_MIN` — Minutes of continuous OOR before auto-rebalance
  (default: `180`, `0`=disabled)
- `SLIPPAGE_PCT` — Max slippage for txns (default: `0.5`)
- `TX_SPEEDUP_SEC` — Seconds before a pending TX is speed-up-replaced
  (default: `120`)
- `TX_CANCEL_SEC` — Seconds before a stuck TX is cancelled via 0-PLS
  self-transfer (default: `1200` = 20 min)
- `CHECK_INTERVAL_SEC` — Poll interval (default: `60`)
- `MIN_REBALANCE_INTERVAL_MIN` — Min wait between rebalances (default: `10`)
- `MAX_REBALANCES_PER_DAY` — Hard daily cap (default: `20`)
- `LOG_FILE` — JSON log path (default: `./app-config/rebalance_log.json`)

### Contract Address Overrides (`.env`)

These variables override the per-chain defaults from
`app-config/static-tunables/chains.json`. In normal operation you should
never need to set them — only edit them if you're pointing the bot at a
custom deployment of the 9mm Pro V3 contracts.

Canonical deployment addresses:
<https://github.com/9mm-exchange/deployments/blob/main/pulsechain/v3.json>

- `POSITION_MANAGER` — NonfungiblePositionManager (default: `0xCC05bf…`)
- `FACTORY` — V3 Factory (default: `0xe50Dbd…`)
- `SWAP_ROUTER` — V3 SwapRouter (default: `0x7bE8fb…`)

### Where Other Configuration Lives

- **Per-chain static tunables** (RPC endpoints, contract addresses, gas
  multipliers, aggregator timeouts) →
  `app-config/static-tunables/chains.json`. Tracked in git, user-editable.
- **Managed positions and per-position settings** (HODL baselines,
  thresholds, slippage overrides, auto-compound config) →
  `app-config/.bot-config.json`. Runtime-managed, gitignored. Written by
  the dashboard and bot loops — not hand-edited.
- **Encrypted wallet** → `app-config/.wallet.json`. Managed via the
  dashboard import flow.
- **Encrypted third-party API keys** (Moralis, etc.) →
  `app-config/api-keys.json`. Managed via the dashboard Settings dialog.

See the [The `app-config` Directory](#the-app-config-directory) section
below for the full inventory and the rules for where future config files
should go.

## USD Pricing

Token prices (for P&L display) are resolved through three sources tried in
priority order, with an in-memory 60-second cache at the top. Implementation
lives in [`src/price-fetcher.js`](../src/price-fetcher.js).

### Current Prices

`fetchTokenPriceUsd()` tries each source in order and returns the first
non-zero result:

1. **Moralis** (primary) — **the API key is free** (sign up at
   <https://moralis.io>); paste it into the dashboard Settings dialog and
   it's encrypted at rest in `app-config/api-keys.json`. Most reliable for
   meme tokens that the free aggregators drop.

   **Free-tier quota caveat:** the free Moralis plan has a daily compute
   quota. Very large position sets, repeated cache clears (`npm run clean`,
   `dev-clean`, or manually deleting `tmp/`), or a rapid sequence of
   "scan a fresh wallet" operations can burn through the daily budget in
   one session. Once the quota is exhausted the key returns a
   usage-exceeded error and **nothing else can be done with that key
   until the next 24-hour cycle rolls over** — the only workarounds are
   to wait it out, upgrade to a paid plan, or rely on the GeckoTerminal /
   DexScreener fallbacks below (which don't give as complete coverage on
   meme tokens).

   Quota-exhaustion errors are parsed separately from invalid-key errors
   so the dashboard shows an **orange** Moralis indicator while you're
   quota-locked, versus a **deep red** indicator for an invalid or
   unauthorized key.
2. **GeckoTerminal** — free, no key needed, but rate-limited to 30 calls/min
   (see "Rate limiting" below).
3. **DexScreener** — free, no key needed, but drops tokens with no 24h LP
   activity, which is why it's the last fallback rather than the first.

### Historical Prices

`fetchHistoricalPriceGecko()` (and the Moralis equivalent) resolves the USD
price of a token at a specific block number. This is how the HODL baseline,
P&L epoch reconstruction, and closed-position history are populated.

The historical flow is substantially more complex than current-price
fetching because GeckoTerminal's OHLCV endpoint requires a **pool address**
and a **pool-side token identifier** (`base` or `quote`) — which don't
always match the Uniswap v3 `token0`/`token1` ordering:

- **Pool orientation cache** — on first lookup per pool, a one-shot GET to
  the GeckoTerminal pool-info endpoint records whether the pool's `base`
  side is `token0` (`normal`) or `token1` (`flipped`). Persisted to
  `tmp/gecko-pool-cache.json`. Without this cache, orientation mismatches
  would produce price ratios that are inverted by orders of magnitude.
- **Block-time cache** — block number → Unix timestamp lookups are cached
  in `tmp/block-time-cache.json` so historical API calls use the correct
  timestamps without re-querying the RPC for every position.
- **Cascading OHLCV fallback** — `_fetchGeckoTerminalOhlcv` requests a day
  candle first; if none exists (e.g. pool inception, low volume), it
  cascades to hour, then minute. Each attempt uses **end-of-UTC-day** as
  the `before_timestamp` so the cascade finds any candle anywhere in the
  block's day.

Historical USD values (token prices, exit/entry amounts) are recorded in
`rebalance_log.json` at rebalance time so subsequent P&L lookups don't need
to re-query historical price APIs for events that have already occurred.

### Rate Limiting

The free GeckoTerminal API allows 30 calls/min. A centralized sliding-window
rate limiter (`geckoRateLimit()` in
[`src/gecko-rate-limit.js`](../src/gecko-rate-limit.js)) is applied to
**every** GeckoTerminal call and is shared between `price-fetcher.js` and
`gecko-pool-cache.js` so all callers (HODL baseline, epoch reconstruction,
position history, pool-orientation bootstraps) draw from a single budget.
If the window is full the caller automatically waits until a slot opens.

### In-Memory Cache

Current-price results are cached with a 60-second TTL, keyed by
`{chain}:{tokenAddress}` (lower-cased). Historical prices have their own
disk-backed cache in `tmp/historical-price-cache.json`, keyed by block
number so the cache survives across restarts and always corresponds to a
deterministic on-chain moment.

---

## Lifetime History Lookback

"Lifetime" P&L figures — total fees earned, every rebalance event, every
compound, cumulative impermanent loss/gain — are computed from the on-chain
history of the wallet's position NFTs. The question of **how far back to
scan** is answered by three layered bounds, resolved in order by
[`src/event-scanner.js`](../src/event-scanner.js):

1. **5-year maximum** (hard upper bound)

   The default `maxYears` parameter is `5`. Block depth is derived from
   PulseChain's 10-second target block time:

   ```text
   _BLOCKS_PER_YEAR = round((365.25 * 24 * 3600) / 10)  =  3,155,760
   baseFrom         = max(0, currentBlock - maxYears * _BLOCKS_PER_YEAR)
   ```

   That's the oldest block the scanner will ever touch. Positions older
   than five years are ignored — if you need a longer window, pass a
   larger `maxYears` to `scanRebalanceHistory()`.

2. **Pool-creation block** (tightens the window for young pools)

   Most pools are nowhere near five years old, so querying every chunk
   back to `baseFrom` would waste thousands of RPC calls on empty ranges.
   Before the chunk loop starts, `resolveFromBlock()` asks the V3 Factory
   for its `PoolCreated(token0, token1, fee)` event; when found, the
   block number of that event becomes the effective `fromBlock`:

   ```text
   effectiveFrom = max(baseFrom, poolCreationBlock)
   ```

   For a pool created six months ago, this collapses a 15.8 M-block scan
   down to ~1.6 M blocks — roughly a 10× speedup on a fresh install.
   `findPoolCreationBlock()` binary-searches the factory event log, so
   the lookup itself is cheap.

3. **Disk cache** (subsequent runs resume from the last scanned block)

   Results from a completed scan are persisted to
   `tmp/event-cache-{blockchain}-{contract}-{wallet}-{token0}-{token1}-{fee}.json`
   via `cache-store.js`. On the next run `loadCache()` reads the cached
   events and sets `scanFrom = lastScannedBlock + 1`, so only blocks
   produced since the previous scan are queried. A 5-year first-time
   scan issues ~1,580 chunked queries (10 k blocks per chunk with a
   250 ms rate-limit delay between them); a warm-cache rescan on the
   same wallet issues a handful.

   The cache is invalidated on every successful rebalance
   (`clearPoolCache()` in `bot-loop.js`) so the next scanner run picks
   up the newly-minted NFT's mint event.

In short: **we start as far back as 5 years ago, but never before the
pool itself was created, and never before the last cached scan.** The
three bounds compose, so the actual `fromBlock` on any given call is
`max(now - 5y, poolCreationBlock, lastCachedBlock + 1)`.

## Client-Side URL Routing

The dashboard uses Navigo (pushState-based router, ~5 KB) for bookmarkable,
shareable URLs that reflect the active wallet and position.

### URL Structure

- `/` — Root (no state)
- `/pulsechain/:wallet` — Wallet loaded, no position selected
- `/pulsechain/:wallet/:contract/:tokenId` — Specific NFT position deep-link

Example: `/pulsechain/0xabc123.../0xCC05bf.../157149`

### SPA Catch-All

The server serves `index.html` for any extensionless GET path that doesn't
match a known API route or static file. Paths with file extensions (e.g.
`.js`, `.css`, `.woff2`) that don't match a real file return 404. This
allows Navigo to handle routing on the client side after page load.

### Deep-Link Resolution Flow

1. Navigo parses wallet, contract, tokenId from the URL path.
2. If the wallet matches the loaded wallet → search posStore for the tokenId
   → activate if found.
3. If the wallet is not yet loaded → store as a pending route target,
   resolved after wallet import or server restore.
4. If the position is not in the store → trigger `scanPositions()` and retry
   lookup (up to 3 retries at 2-second intervals).

### URL Updates

When the user selects a position or imports/clears a wallet, the URL bar is
updated via `router.navigate()` with `callHandler: false` (no page reload,
no re-triggering of route handlers). Addresses are lowercased in URLs.

Source: [`public/dashboard-router.js`](../public/dashboard-router.js)

## Development Tools

All dev tools are available via npm scripts — no `npx` needed.

### Build and Run

- `npm run build` — esbuild bundle + cache-bust stamp (`bundle.js?v=<ms>`)
- `npm start` — Start server only (no build — use after `npm run build`)
- `npm run build-and-start` — Build + start in one command
- `npm run dev` — Build + start with `--watch` (auto-restart on file changes)

### Lint and Test

**Caution — read before running any lint or test command.** `npm run check`,
`npm test`, and their variants actively write to config and cache files
during test execution. Those files are backed up by `scripts/check.sh`
before the tests start and restored automatically when the process exits.
However, if you Ctrl-C the process mid-run, the restore may not complete
and the files will be left in a state that is only appropriate for the
automated tests (stub position keys, missing managed positions, etc.).
**Always let tests and checks finish before interrupting.**

**Step 1 — back up your real state out of tree (do this once per machine
before your first run):**

```sh
mkdir -p ../app-config-backup
cp -R ./app-config ../app-config-backup/
cp .env ../app-config-backup
```

If you ever end up with corrupted state after an interrupted run, restore
from `../app-config-backup/`. `npm run clean` is also available as a
nuclear option — it wipes runtime files entirely and triggers full-length
blockchain wallet scans on next start to rebuild caches.

**Step 2 — run the commands:**

- `npm run lint` — ESLint — 0 warnings, complexity ≤17, max-lines ≤500
- `npm run lint:fix` — ESLint auto-fix
- `npm test` — Node.js built-in test runner (`node:test`)
- `npm run test:coverage` — Test coverage report (Node 20+,
  `--experimental-test-coverage`)
- `npm run test:watch` — Re-run tests on file changes
- `npm run check` — Combined lint + test + 80% coverage gate + security
  audits (matches CI)

### Wallet Management

- `npm run reset-wallet` — Delete `app-config/.wallet.json` + clear
  `WALLET_PASSWORD` from `.env`. Forces a fresh wallet import via the
  dashboard on next start.
- `npm run clean` — `reset-wallet` + delete every runtime file in
  `app-config/` (`.bot-config.json`, `.bot-config.backup.json`,
  `api-keys.json`, `rebalance_log.json`) plus all `tmp/` caches and the
  entire `test/report-artifacts/` directory. Full state reset.
  **Note:** browser localStorage is NOT cleared by this command — use the
  Settings gear icon → "Clear Local Storage & Cookies" in the dashboard,
  or open DevTools → Application → Local Storage → Clear All.
- `npm run dev-clean` — Same as `clean` but preserves the historical price
  cache (`tmp/historical-price-cache.json`), the block-time cache
  (`tmp/block-time-cache.json`), and the gecko-pool orientation cache
  (`tmp/gecko-pool-cache.json`) for faster restart during development.
  Avoids re-fetching GeckoTerminal data.

### Housekeeping

- `npm run nuke` — Delete `node_modules` + `package-lock.json` for a clean
  reinstall. Run `npm install` afterwards.
- `npm run wipe-settings` — Back up all user settings/state (`.env`, every
  runtime file in `app-config/`, `tmp/pnl-epochs-cache.json`,
  `tmp/event-cache*.json`, `*.keyfile.json`) to `tmp/.settings-backup/` and
  remove them — simulates a fresh install. Also clear browser localStorage
  via Settings gear → "Clear Local Storage & Cookies" to complete the
  simulation.
- `npm run restore-settings` — Restore settings previously backed up by
  `wipe-settings`.
- `npm run view-report` — Open `test/report-artifacts/report.pdf` via
  `xdg-open` (Linux dev box).

## The app-config Directory

**Read this before adding new config files.**

Every file the app reads or writes for its own configuration and runtime
state lives in ONE dedicated directory at the project root:

```text
lp-ranger/
└── app-config/
    ├── static-tunables/      ← tracked in git, user-editable
    │   └── chains.json       ← per-blockchain tunables (RPC, contracts, gas)
    ├── api-keys.example.json ← tracked format template (documentation)
    ├── .bot-config.json      ← runtime (gitignored) — managed positions
    ├── .bot-config.backup.json  ← runtime (gitignored) — auto snapshot
    ├── .bot-config.v1.json   ← legacy format, kept for rollback
    ├── .wallet.json          ← runtime (gitignored) — encrypted wallet
    ├── api-keys.json         ← runtime (gitignored) — encrypted API keys
    └── rebalance_log.json    ← runtime (gitignored) — historical P&L events
```

Pure performance caches (historical prices, block times, OHLCV pool
orientation, event scanner results, LP position enumeration) DO NOT belong
here — they live in `tmp/` and are rebuilt on demand from the blockchain or
APIs. Deleting any cache file in `tmp/` is always safe; the app will
regenerate it.

### File Inventory

- **`static-tunables/chains.json`** — Tracked. Per-blockchain config: RPC
  endpoints, contract addresses (PositionManager, Factory, SwapRouter), gas
  multipliers, aggregator cancel timeout, wait window, retry count. Read
  once at module load by `src/config.js`. Users edit this file directly for
  chain-specific tweaks.
- **`api-keys.example.json`** — Tracked. Format template showing the
  structure of the encrypted `api-keys.json`. NOT a tunable, NOT a runtime
  file — pure documentation. Lives at `app-config/` top level because it
  directly documents its gitignored sibling.
- **`.bot-config.json`** — Runtime, gitignored. Managed position lifecycle
  (`status: running/stopped`), per-position settings (HODL baseline,
  residuals, thresholds, slippage, auto-compound config, compound history,
  initial deposit overrides), global bot settings. Read/written by
  `src/bot-config-v2.js` via `loadConfig()` / `saveConfig()`. Atomic write
  (tmp + rename); every write is logged with the caller's stack for
  config-stomp debugging.
- **`.bot-config.backup.json`** — Runtime, gitignored. Automatic snapshot
  created by bot-config-v2 on every successful load. Safety net for the
  ongoing config-stomp investigation — if `.bot-config.json` is ever
  accidentally truncated, copy this file back over it:

  ```sh
  cp app-config/.bot-config.backup.json app-config/.bot-config.json
  ```

  The save guard also logs `[config] REFUSING` when it detects that running
  positions would vanish; if you see that warning, use the backup.
- **`.bot-config.v1.json`** — Legacy format from before the v1→v2 migration.
  Kept on disk for rollback history; not read by the current code.
- **`.wallet.json`** — Runtime, gitignored. Encrypted wallet state
  (AES-256-GCM with PBKDF2-SHA512 key derivation from the user's password).
  Holds address, source (generated/seed/key), encrypted private key and
  mnemonic. Plaintext secrets are NEVER written to disk. Read/written by
  `src/wallet-manager.js`. Tests override the path via the
  `WALLET_FILE_PATH` environment variable.
- **`api-keys.json`** — Runtime, gitignored. Encrypted storage for
  third-party API keys (e.g. Moralis), using the same wallet password and
  encryption scheme as `.wallet.json`. Read/written by `src/api-key-store.js`.
  Tests override the path via the `API_KEYS_FILE_PATH` environment variable.
- **`rebalance_log.json`** — Runtime, gitignored. JSON array of every
  rebalance event ever: timestamps, fees collected, gas cost, exit/entry USD
  values, token balances. Appended to by `src/bot-recorder.js`. Read by
  `src/position-history.js` for closed-position P&L display. Configurable
  via the `LOG_FILE` environment variable.

### Rules for Where Future Config Files Should Live

1. **Pure static tunable** (tracked, user-editable, NEVER rewritten by the
   app at runtime) → `app-config/static-tunables/<name>.json`
2. **Runtime state** (written by the app, not meant for the user to
   hand-edit) → `app-config/<name>.json` (add to `.gitignore` via the
   `app-config/*` glob)
3. **Mixed static + dynamic** (has tracked defaults that the app also
   overwrites during normal operation) → `app-config/<name>.json` (NOT
   `static-tunables/`). The `static-tunables/` subdir is reserved for files
   that are read-only at runtime — if the app can rewrite the file, it
   doesn't belong there.
4. **Format template** documenting a runtime file →
   `app-config/<name>.example.json` (tracked; add an explicit un-ignore
   rule to `.gitignore`).
5. **Pure performance cache** (can be deleted with no loss of data; rebuilt
   on demand from the blockchain or an API) → `tmp/<name>.json`. DO NOT
   put caches in `app-config/`.

### One-Time Migration from the Legacy Layout

Existing installations prior to this refactor kept runtime files at the
project root (`.bot-config.json`, `.wallet.json`, `api-keys.json`, etc.).
On every startup, `src/migrate-app-config.js` runs `migrateAppConfig()`
which moves any surviving legacy root file into `app-config/`. The
migration is fully idempotent:

- **Fresh install** → creates `app-config/`, moves nothing.
- **Upgrade** → `fs.renameSync` each legacy file into place, logs each move.
- **Conflict** (both root AND `app-config/` exist) → refuses, logs a
  warning, leaves both files untouched so the operator can resolve manually.
- **After a successful migration** → subsequent restarts are completely
  silent (source files no longer exist at root).

`fs.renameSync` is atomic within a single filesystem, so there is no window
where a file could be lost to an interrupted move.

### Test-Time Protection in scripts/check.sh

`scripts/check.sh` (which `npm run check` invokes) backs up every top-level
file in `app-config/` before running tests, wipes them, runs the full test
suite, then restores the originals via an `EXIT` trap. This prevents
test-created fixtures from ever clobbering live user state. The
`static-tunables/` subdir and the `api-keys.example.json` template are
explicitly excluded from the backup/wipe — they're tracked repo files.

Tests that need to write config without touching the live files either
pass an explicit `dir` argument to `loadConfig(dir)` / `saveConfig(cfg, dir)`
(`bot-config-v2`), or set the `WALLET_FILE_PATH` / `API_KEYS_FILE_PATH`
environment variables to a temp path before require-ing the module.

---

## Check Report Artifacts

`npm run check` (via `scripts/check.sh`) runs lint + tests + coverage +
security audits and writes a full set of report artifacts to
`test/report-artifacts/`. The whole directory is gitignored — timings and
machine-specific data are noisy and not worth committing.

- Test failures (name + count, up to 10)
- npm audit severity breakdown (critical / high / moderate / low / info)

### Workflow

1. `npm run check` runs each tool, writes its raw output into `raw-data/`
   (and the two text-only captures directly into `text-reports/`), then
   runs `scripts/check-report.js` which parses everything, prints the
   terminal summary, and writes `text-reports/summary.txt`,
   `text-reports/summary.md`, `text-reports/tests-summary.txt`, and
   `report.pdf`.
2. `npm run view-report` opens the PDF (uses `xdg-open`; Linux dev box).
3. To re-render the summaries and PDF **without** re-running any tools
   (e.g. after tweaking `scripts/check-report-pdf.js`), just run
   `node scripts/check-report.js` — the aggregator reads the
   previously-captured `raw-data/` files and regenerates everything.
4. GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `npm run check` on the
   Node 22/24 matrix, appends `text-reports/summary.md` to
   `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` so the rollup renders inline on every run page,
   and uploads the whole `test/report-artifacts/` directory as a
   downloadable workflow artifact (`check-report-node-<ver>`). Reviewers
   can read the summary without clicking anywhere, and download the PDF +
   raw data when they need to dig deeper.

### Adding a New Tool to the Report

1. Add the tool invocation to `scripts/check.sh` with its JSON/TAP
   formatter flag, redirecting stdout into `raw-data/<tool>.json`.
2. Capture its exit code into `exit-codes.json` alongside the others.
3. Add a parser function to `scripts/check-report-parse.js`.
4. Wire it into `loadResults()` in `scripts/check-report.js` and add a
   row to `overviewRows`.
5. Add a section (or table row) to `scripts/check-report-pdf.js` if it
   deserves its own block in the PDF.

The aggregator never re-runs tools itself, and `check.sh` never parses
JSON — keeping the two concerns separate means a broken PDF template
can't corrupt raw tool data, and a broken parser can't corrupt a
previously-good PDF.

## API Documentation

The authoritative reference for every HTTP route, request/response schema,
and status code the server exposes is the **OpenAPI 3.0 spec** in
[`docs/openapi.json`](openapi.json), rendered as an interactive explorer
by a lightweight local HTTP server that uses **[Scalar](https://scalar.com)**
(`@scalar/api-reference`) as the renderer. Scalar has a polished native
dark theme that matches the rest of LP Ranger's palette, plus interactive
"Try it out" support — it's a modern replacement for the old Swagger UI.
The brief ROUTES list in [`server.js`](../server.js)'s file-header is a
human-readable index, not the full spec.

### Starting the Local API Reference Server

```sh
npm run api-doc
```

This runs [`scripts/api-doc.js`](../scripts/api-doc.js), which starts a
standalone HTTP server on **<http://localhost:5556>**. The server is
independent of the main dashboard — you can run it alongside
`npm start` (which uses port 5555) without conflict. (The script was
called `npm run swagger` before the Scalar migration; the old name no
longer exists.)

How it works:

- `scripts/api-doc.js` serves an `index.html` shim that loads Scalar's
  standalone browser bundle from
  `node_modules/@scalar/api-reference/dist/browser/standalone.js` via
  a `/scalar-standalone.js` route.
- The shim passes `data-url="/openapi.json"` and
  `data-configuration='{"darkMode":true,…}'` to Scalar's bootstrap
  `<script id="api-reference">` element.
- `/openapi.json` streams `docs/openapi.json` from disk on every request
  — no caching, no build step, no code generation.

The whole server is ~70 lines of hand-written Node HTTP with three
routes (`/`, `/openapi.json`, `/scalar-standalone.js`). Everything else
404s.

Stop the server with `Ctrl-C`. There is no shared PID file or `npm run
stop` integration for it — it's a dev tool, not part of the bot's
runtime.

### Updating the Spec When the API Changes

The spec is a single hand-maintained file at
[`docs/openapi.json`](openapi.json). There's **no code generation** —
route handlers do not auto-publish their schemas — so any route change
in `src/server-routes.js`, `src/server-positions.js`, or
`src/server-scan.js` must be mirrored by hand into `openapi.json`.

Typical workflow when you add, rename, or change an API route:

1. **Make the code change** in the appropriate `src/server-*.js` file
   and its call-site in `server.js`. Add/update the test in
   `test/server-*.test.js`.
2. **Open [`docs/openapi.json`](openapi.json)** and find (or add) the
   entry for the affected path under the top-level `paths` object. The
   file is organised by path first, then HTTP method:

   ```json
   "paths": {
     "/api/position/manage": {
       "post": { "tags": [...], "summary": "...", "requestBody": {...}, "responses": {...} },
       "delete": { ... }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Update the fields that changed:**
   - `summary` and `description` — human-readable route purpose.
   - `tags` — one of the top-level tags declared in the `tags` array
     (`Status`, `Config`, `Wallet`, `Positions`, `Rebalance`,
     `Compound`, `System`). Add a new tag if the route doesn't fit any
     existing category.
   - `requestBody.content.application/json.schema` — the JSON shape of
     the expected request body, either inline or as a `$ref` into
     `components.schemas`.
   - `responses` — at minimum a `200` (or `201`/`204`) success case and
     the error cases the handler actually returns (`400`, `401`, `404`,
     `409`, `500`). Each response's `content.application/json.schema`
     documents the return shape.
4. **Reuse component schemas where you can.** Common shapes live under
   `components.schemas` at the bottom of the file (positions, wallet
   status, etc.). Add new shared shapes there rather than inlining the
   same object in multiple routes.
5. **Verify the spec renders.** Either:
   - Start Scalar with `npm run api-doc` and open
     <http://localhost:5556> — every path should render in the sidebar
     under the correct tag. Invalid spec structure surfaces as a Scalar
     runtime error in the browser console.
   - Or validate headlessly: `node -e "JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('docs/openapi.json'))"`
     will at least catch JSON syntax errors. For a full OpenAPI 3.0
     validation pass, paste the file into
     <https://editor.swagger.io> — it's browser-side and doesn't
     require installing anything.
6. **Click through the affected route in Scalar's "Try it out"
   panel** to confirm the request body, response codes, and
   content-types render as expected.
7. **Run `npm run check`.** `docs/openapi.json` is not linted (it's a
   generated-style artifact even though it's hand-edited), but the
   file must still parse as valid JSON or Scalar will fail to load
   `/openapi.json`.
8. **Commit the spec change in the same commit as the route change**
   — this keeps the spec and the implementation from drifting in
   reviewable diffs.

### Reference

- `info.title` / `info.version` — bump `info.version` when you ship a
  breaking API change.
- `servers[]` — the local dev server URL. Not exercised in production
  (there's no hosted instance), but the value matters for Swagger UI's
  "Try it out" feature: requests go to whatever URL is listed here.
- `components.schemas` — shared request/response shapes.
- `tags[]` — category labels that group routes in the UI sidebar. Add
  a new tag only when a route genuinely doesn't fit an existing one.

## `server.js`

`server.js` is the execution entry point for the dashboard+bot process
(`npm start` / `npm run build-and-start`). The headless-bot variant
(`npm run bot`) is a thin wrapper around the same internals; see
[`bot.js`](../bot.js) for that path.

What happens when the process starts, in order:

1. **Colored logging is installed.** `installColorLogger()` from
   [`src/logger.js`](../src/logger.js) wraps `console.log`/`warn`/`error`
   so bracketed prefixes like `[server]`, `[bot]`, `[rebalance]` render
   in distinct colors and module-specific emoji IDs.
2. **`--help` / `-h` short-circuit.** If the flag is on `argv`,
   [`src/cli-help.js`](../src/cli-help.js) prints the usage text and the
   process exits with status 0 — nothing below runs.
3. **Core modules are required.** `http`, `fs`, `path`, then the app's
   own modules: `config` (env-var parsing), `walletManager`,
   `position-history`, `rebalance-lock`, `position-manager`,
   `bot-config-v2`, `migrate-app-config`. Requiring `src/config.js`
   also loads `app-config/static-tunables/chains.json` for the current
   `CHAIN_NAME`.
4. **Legacy config migration runs once.** `migrateAppConfig()` moves
   any surviving legacy root-level config files (`.bot-config.json`,
   `.wallet.json`, `api-keys.json`, `rebalance_log.json`) into
   `app-config/`. Idempotent — a no-op after the first successful run.
   See the [The `app-config` Directory](#the-app-config-directory)
   section for details.
5. **Module-level singletons are created.** A single `rebalanceLock`
   (async mutex) and a single `positionManager` are instantiated and
   shared by every route handler and bot loop in the process.
6. **On-disk bot config is loaded.** `loadConfig()` reads
   `app-config/.bot-config.json`. Every managed position's composite
   key and `status` is logged so config-stomp incidents are visible in
   the console at boot. A successful load also writes
   `.bot-config.backup.json` as a safety net.
7. **The HTTP server is created.** `http.createServer(handleRequest)`
   builds the server object; `requestTimeout` is raised to
   `config.SCAN_TIMEOUT_MS` so lifetime P&L scans (which can take
   5+ minutes on older pools) don't get cut off by Node's default
   300-second timeout.
8. **If run directly (`require.main === module`)**:
   1. `start()` calls `server.listen(PORT, HOST)` and logs the
      blockchain name, NFT factory, wallet address (or `(not loaded)`),
      dashboard URL, `/api/status` URL, port, and `/health` URL.
   2. `_tryResolveKey()` tries to obtain the wallet private key —
      either from `PRIVATE_KEY` in `.env`, from a
      `WALLET_PASSWORD`-decrypted `app-config/.wallet.json`, or from
      an interactive prompt.
      - On success: `_autoStartManagedPositions()` spins up one bot
        loop per position whose v2 config has `status: 'running'`.
        Multi-position staggering inserts
        `CHECK_INTERVAL_SEC / N` ms between loop starts so they don't
        all poll the RPC on the same tick.
      - If the wallet is locked: logs
        `Wallet locked — unlock via dashboard to start bot.` and
        enters dashboard-only mode until the user unlocks via
        `POST /api/wallet/unlock`.
      - If no wallet exists: logs `No wallet key — dashboard-only mode`.
   3. `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` handlers are installed. Each calls
      `_positionMgr.stopAll()` (which drains every bot loop through
      the rebalance lock) and then closes the HTTP server. A 3-second
      watchdog `setTimeout` forces exit if graceful shutdown hangs.
   4. A diagnostic `process.on('exit', …)` handler logs the final
      count of positions in memory vs. positions in `status: 'running'`
      — this catches config-stomp bugs where positions silently vanish
      mid-run.
9. **If imported as a module (e.g. from a test)**: nothing in step 8
   runs. The caller controls `start()` / `stop()` lifecycle explicitly.

The dashboard is served as static files from `public/` by `serveStatic()`;
all JSON APIs are dispatched by `handleRequest()` through a route table
that maps method+path to handlers defined in
[`src/server-routes.js`](../src/server-routes.js) and
[`src/server-positions.js`](../src/server-positions.js). The full route
surface is covered by the Swagger spec (see
[API Documentation](#api-documentation) above).

## Dead Code Detection

- `npm run knip` — [Knip](https://knip.dev) — finds unused exports, files,
  and dependencies. Note: the 8 `public/dashboard-*.js` files are false
  positives because knip cannot trace HTML `<script>` tags.

---

## Debugging

Server logs are printed to the terminal (stdout/stderr) with bracketed
prefixes like `[bot]`, `[server]`, `[rebalance]`, `[compound]`,
`[event-scanner]`. Use `--verbose` (`-v`) for additional per-cycle detail.

Browser console logs use the `[lp-ranger]` prefix with a colored log-type
signifier, e.g. `[lp-ranger] [scan]`, `[lp-ranger] [unmanaged]`.
High-frequency per-poll-cycle logs (`[poll]`, `[update]`, `[skip]`,
`[deposit]`) use `console.debug` and are hidden by default in Chrome
DevTools. To see them, open DevTools → Console → click the log-level
dropdown (defaults to "Default levels") and enable "Verbose".
